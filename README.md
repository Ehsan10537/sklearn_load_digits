In this project I have performed multi-class classification using Decision Tree algorithm, and explored some of the hyperparameters to see the change in the performance of the algorithm.\
The Dataset is loaded from Scikit-Learn database and contains digits representing the pixles of images which are handwritten numbers ranging from 0 to 9.\
The label column is also included which represents the number shown in the image.\
Each row represents a digitized image of size 8*8 pixles, which are now vectorized as dataframe rows.\
Updates will be added to the project.\
